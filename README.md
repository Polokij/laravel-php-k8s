## ü§ù Supporting

Renoki Co. loves building open source (and helpful) projects on Github for any developer to have an easier job at building products. üì¶ Developing and maintaining projects is a harsh job and tho, we love it.

If you are using your application in your day-to-day job, on presentation demos, hobby projects, or even school projects, spread some kind words about our work or sponsor our work.

_Kind words will touch our chakras and vibe, while the sponsorships will keep the open-source projects alive._
